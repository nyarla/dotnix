      Noto Sans CJK is a sans serif typeface designed as an intermediate style
      between the modern and traditional. It is intended to be a multi-purpose
      digital font for user interface designs, digital content, reading on laptops,
      mobile devices, and electronic books. Noto Sans CJK comprehensively covers
      Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, and Korean in a unified font
      family. It supports regional variants of ideographic characters for each of the
      four languages. In addition, it supports Japanese kana, vertical forms, and
      variant characters (itaiji); it supports Korean hangeul â€” both contemporary and
      archaic.
